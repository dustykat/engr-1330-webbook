# ENGR 1330 Computational Thinking with Data Science

## Course Description: 
Introducion to Python programming, its relevant modules and libraries, and computational thinking for solving problems in Data Science. Data science approaches for importing, manipulating, and analyzing data.  Modeling and visualizing real-world data sets in various science and engineering disciplines.

3 credit hours comprising of lectures and hands-on lab sessions.

This course provides a hands-on learning experience in programming and data science using iPython and JupyterLab. iPython is the interactive python kernel implemented in JupyterLab. 

## Prerequisites: 

Prior programming background is NOT required.  The course is intended for first-year WCOE students (aka engineering foundational) 


## COVID-19 Important Guidelines:
* If Texas Tech University campus operations are required to change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format.  Should that be necessary, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.  

* Policy on absences resulting from illness: We anticipate that some students may have extended absences.  To avoid students feeling compelled to attend in-person class periods when having symptoms or feeling unwell, a standard policy is provided that holds students harmless for illness-related absences (see Section A below).


### A. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Face-to-Face Classes)
If at any time during the semester you are ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused.  These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness.

1. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related:

    1. Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  During after-hours and on weekends, contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at TBD.
    2. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week.
    3. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the time you may be absent from and may return to classes.
    4. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps 2.a-d below.


2. If you are ill and can attribute your symptoms to something other than COVID-19:

    1. If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to contact either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits.
    2. During the health provider visit, request a “return to school” note.
    3. E-mail the instructor a picture of that note.
    4. Return to class by the next class period after the date indicated on your note.

Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused.  You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness.

### B. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Telepresence/On-Line Classes)
Same as above with respect potential to infect others; go to a health care provider if you are ill.  Telepresence courses are recorded and will be available on TTU MediaSite and/or YouTube (unlisted).  Exercises, Quizzes, and Examinations are all administered by a Learning Management System (Blackboard) and students need to allow enough time to complete and upload their work.  Due date adjustments/late submits on case-by-case basis; documentation required as in subsection **A** above.

## Resources/Tools
### Platforms for Python Programming (for your own computers)

1. Anaconda platform (https://www.anaconda.com/): Anaconda distribution is an open-source Data Science Distribution Development Platform.  It includes Python 3 with over 1,500 data science packages making it easy to manage libraries and dependencies.  Available in Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.  

2. Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/): JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: Configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. `note` Anaconda for MacOS includes a JupyterLab instance, so a separate install is not required.

### Additional Modules for Python Programming
3. Math module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html): Gives access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard e.g. factorial, gcd, exponential, logarithm. 
4. Operator module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html): Helps in exporting a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python.  For example, the operator add(x,y) is equivalent to the expression x+y.

### Python Modules for Data Science
5. Scipy module (https://www.scipy.org/): A Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Some of the core packages are:
    * Numpy: Provides n-dimensional array package
    * Scipy: Fundamental for scientific computing (e.g. linear algorithm, optimization)
    * Matplotlib: Visualizations/2D plotting
    * IPython: Enhanced interactive console <<= this is the kernel used in JupyterLab
    * Pandas: Data structures and data analysis
6. Scikit-learn module (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A library for machine learning in Python. It is a simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis.  It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib modules.
 
### On-Line Options
- AWS Lightsail Instance (use Windows Server 2000 template; lowest resource provision tier; AWS RDP client, or download and install own RDP client) 
    1. Then install Anaconda onto the AWS Instance

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimal, in fact this syllabus was created using a JupyterLab notebook (as a markdown processor) on a Raspberry Pi 4B, which technically cannot support a JupyterHub, but does.  
- Your current laptop should be fine, or if you only have a chromebook, build an AWS instance.

The college of engineering has specific laptop requirements for your other courses that are listed at https://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/dean/engineeringitservices/buyingtherightcomputer.php

### Content Server
Blackboard is used as the learning management system (LMS) for this class, and it uses web links to a content server at https://3.137.111.182/engr-1330-webroot/  The Blackboard links will generally go directly to a section in the webroot, but feel free to explore by going in the front door!

### Telepresence (On-line) Courses
Obviously electronic devices are vital; disrupting the conference is prohibited, please mute your microphone unless you have a question - consider typing your question into the chat window as well. Be aware of bandwidth issues and remember most lessons and laboratory sessions are recorded and posted on youtube.  Recording, editing, and rendering takes awhile, so expect 24-36 hour delay before video is available. 

---
## ADA Statement: 
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements.  Students must present appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the instructor's office hours.  Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from Student Disability Services has been provided.  For additional information, please contact Student Disability Services 
office in 335 West Hall or call 806.742.2405.

## Academic Integrity Statement:
Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one’s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior.  Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility.  Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect.  Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured.  Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors.  Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.  Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.  Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.  [Texas Tech University (“University”) Quality Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010].

## Religious Holy Day Statement: 
“Religious holy day” means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.  A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence.  A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.  A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

## Ethical Conduct Policy:
Cheating is prohibited, and the representation of the work of another person as your own will be grounds for receiving a failing grade in the course.

**DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE STATEMENT:**
Texas Tech University is committed to providing and strengthening an educational, working, and living environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors are free from gender and/or sex discrimination of any kind.

Further, the classroom is a setting in which an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. Students who disrupt this classroom mission by rude, sarcastic, threatening, abusive or obscene language and/or behavior will be subject to appropriate sanctions according to university policy. Likewise, faculty members are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all interactions with all constituents of the university.
To ensure that you are fully engaged in class discussions and account team meetings during class time, you are expected to do the following:
- Maintain the same level of civility and professionalism that would be expected in a face-to-face classroom setting.
- Attend all classes regularly.
- Log into the video conference on time and remain logged in for the duration of the class period.
- Activate your camera so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class. If you have concerns about leaving your camera on (such as childcare obligations, privacy issues, or a particular circumstance during a class period), please talk to the instructor.
- Refrain from engaging in non-class related activities during class time that create a distraction for other students in the class and/or limit your ability to engage in the course.
Failure to meet these expectations may result in the following consequences:
1. Being counted as absent for the class meeting.
2. Not receiving credit for class participation for that class period.
3. Other consequences as stipulated in the syllabus, Texas Tech Code of Student Conduct, or other university policy.
Repeated failure to meet expectations (e.g., attendance, participation in class, etc.), in addition to the above consequences, may result in the one or more of the following consequences:
1. Referral to the appropriate Associate Dean.
2. Academic penalty, ranging from a warning to failure of the course.
