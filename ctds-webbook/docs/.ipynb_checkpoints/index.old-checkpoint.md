At TTU the actual course is accessed from **blackboard.ttu.edu**, using individual instructor content to replace selected (or all) content in the sample course framework. The lead author uses the entire content herein verbatim; other contribuitors adapt the content to their specific sections.  The webbook component is common to all sections.

## Document History
This document is a living document and is updated frequently, Python is an ever evolving tool and stuff that works today will be constructively broken by the development team (python.org) in their quest for continuous improvement.  Generally these changes occur in the packages (libraries, external modules) and primative python is quite stable.

## Administrator Notes
The lead author built this webbook/webcourse/webdata on a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB) running Ubuntu 20.XX, an Apache Web Server, a JupyterHub (fully encrypted) with iPython extensions, R core, Latex, and MkDocs with extensions.  The deployment hardware is an Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Server (Lightsail Instance) in the West Virginia Server Farm (typically the container is run on x86-64 Xeon hardware)

Direct access to the notebook directories is on the to-do-list.
