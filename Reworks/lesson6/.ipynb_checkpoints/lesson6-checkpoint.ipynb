    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a ***class*** is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ***object*** is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header (ClassName in the example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called instantiation\n",

    "# Files and Filesystems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely (not in the secretive context, but specifically somewhere on a piece of hardware) in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. Files can be edited and transferred through the internet on that particular computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of computer files, designed for different purposes. A file may be designed to store a picture, a written message, a video, a computer program, or a wide variety of other kinds of data. Some types of files can store several types of information at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file. Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, files are organised in a file system, which keeps track of where the files are located on disk and enables user access. \n",
    "\n",
    "### File system\n",
    "In computing, a file system or filesystem, controls how data is stored and retrieved. \n",
    "Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. \n",
    "By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is isolated and identified. \n",
    "Taking its name from the way paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a “file”. \n",
    "The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a “file system”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path\n",
    "A path, the general form of the name of a file or directory, specifies a unique location in a file system. A path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash (”/”), the backslash character (”\\”), or colon (”:”), though some operating systems may use a different delimiter.\n",
    "Paths are used extensively in computer science to represent the directory/file relationships common in modern operating systems, and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Resources can be represented by either absolute or relative paths.\n",
    "As an example consider the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. /Users/theodore/MyGit/@atomickitty/hurri-sensors/.git/Guest.conf \n",
    "2. /etc/apache2/users/Guest.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "They both have the same file name, but are located on different paths. \n",
    "Failure to provide the path when addressing the file can be a problem. \n",
    "Another way to interpret is that the two unique files actually have different names, and only part of those names is common (Guest.conf)\n",
    "The two names above (including the path) are called fully qualified filenames (or absolute names), a relative path (usually relative to the file or program of interest depends on where in the directory structure the file lives. \n",
    "If we are currently in the .git directory (the first file) the path to the file is just the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have experienced path issues with dependencies on .png files - in general your JupyterLab notebooks on CoCalc can only look at the local directory which is why we have to copy files into the directory for things to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Files. Text files are regular files that contain information readable by the user. This information is stored in ASCII. You can display and print these files. The lines of a text file must not contain NULL characters, and none can exceed a prescribed (by architecture) length, including the new-line character.  The term text file does not prevent the inclusion of control or other nonprintable characters (other than NUL). Therefore, standard utilities that list text files as inputs or outputs are either able to process the special characters gracefully or they explicitly describe their limitations within their individual sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary Files. Binary files are regular files that contain information readable by the computer. Binary files may be executable files that instruct the system to accomplish a job. Commands and programs are stored in executable, binary files. Special compiling programs translate ASCII text into binary code.  The only difference between text and binary files is that text files have lines of less than some length, with no NULL characters, each terminated by a new-line character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Directory Files. Directory files contain information the system needs to access all types of files, but they do not contain the actual file data. As a result, directories occupy less space than a regular file and give the file system structure flexibility and depth. Each directory entry represents either a file or a subdirectory. Each entry contains the name of the file and the file's index node reference number (i-node). The i-node points to the unique index node assigned to the file. The i-node describes the location of the data associated with the file. Directories are created and controlled by a separate set of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson we examine just a handfull of file manipulations which are quite useful. Files can be \"created\",\"read\",\"updated\", or \"deleted\" (CRUD). "
