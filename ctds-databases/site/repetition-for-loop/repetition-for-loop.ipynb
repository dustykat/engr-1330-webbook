    "# FOR ... loop\n",
    "## Count controlled repetition structure\n",
    "Count-controlled repetition is also called definite repetition because the number of repetitions is known before the loop begins executing. \n",
    "When we do not know in advance the number of times we want to execute a statement, count-controlled repetition becomes a challenge, instead we would use sentinel-controlled repetition. \n",
    "\n",
    "A count-controlled repetition will exit after running a certain number of times. \n",
    "The count is kept in a variable called an index or counter. \n",
    "When the index reaches a certain value (the loop bound) the loop will end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Count-controlled repetition requires\n",
    "\n",
    "* control variable (or loop counter)\n",
    "* initial value of the control variable\n",
    "* increment (or decrement) by which the control variable is modified each iteration through the loop\n",
    "* condition that tests for the final value of the control variable \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use both `for` and `while` loops, for count controlled repetition, but the `for` loop in combination with the `range()` function is more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured `FOR` loop\n",
    "We have seen the for loop already, but we will formally introduce it here. The `for` loop executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the `for` statement is no longer true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping through an iterable\n",
    "An iterable is anything that can be looped over - typically a list, string, or tuple. \n",
    "The syntax for looping through an iterable is illustrated by an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a generic syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "    for a in iterable:\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice our friends the colon `:` and the indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `range()` function to create an iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range(begin,end,increment)` function will create an iterable starting at a value of begin, in steps defined by increment (`begin += increment`), ending at `end`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So a generic syntax becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "    for a in range(begin,end,increment):\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples that follow are count-controlled repetition (increment skip if greater)"
