    "## Sentinel-controlled repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When loop control is based on the value of what we are processing, sentinel-controlled repetition is used. \n",
    "Sentinel-controlled repetition is also called indefinite repetition because it is not known in advance how many times the loop will be executed. \n",
    "It is a repetition procedure for solving a problem by using a sentinel value (also called a signal value, a dummy value or a flag value) to indicate \"end of process\". \n",
    "The sentinel value itself need not be a part of the processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common example of using sentinel-controlled repetition is when we are processing data from a file and we do not know in advance when we would reach the end of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use both `for` and `while` loops, for __Sentinel__ controlled repetition, but the `while` loop is more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured `WHILE` loop\n",
    "The `while` loop repeats a block of instructions inside the loop while a condition remainsvtrue.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a generic syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "    while condition is true:\n",
    "        execute a\n",
    "        execute b\n",
    "    ....\n",
