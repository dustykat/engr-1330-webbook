## Document History
This document is a living document and is updated frequently, Python is an ever evolving tool and stuff that works today will be constructively broken by the development team (python.org) in their quest for continuous improvement.  Generally these changes occur in the packages (libraries, external modules) and primative python is quite stable.

## Administrator Notes
The lead author built this webbook on a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB) running Ubuntu 20.XX, an Apache Web Server, a JupyterHub (fully encrypted) with iPython extensions, R core, Latex, and MkDocs with extensions.  The deployment hardware is an Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Server (Lightsail Instance) in the West Virginia Server Farm (typically the container is run on x86-64 Xeon hardware)

Direct editing on the AWS server is possible, but the typesetting may not render correctly; additionally running some of the notebooks will use up the daily allocation of compute time on the server and the whole thing will hang up; remember to do all development and testing on the Raspberry PI or your laptop.  The development server is hardware cloned weekly (it takes 12 hours, during which it is inaccessible)
