    "## Computational Thinking Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational thinking (CT) refers to the thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what follows is borrowed from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696102/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696102/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational thinking is taking an approach to solving problems, designing systems and understanding human behaviour that draws on concepts fundamental to computing [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational thinking is a kind of analytical thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It shares with mathematical thinking in the general ways in which we might approach solving a problem. \n",
    "- It shares with engineering thinking in the general ways in which we might approach designing and evaluating a large, complex system that operates within the constraints of the real world. - It shares with scientific thinking in the general ways in which we might approach understanding computability, intelligence, the mind and human behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of computational thinking is **abstraction** and **automation**. \n",
    "In computing, we abstract notions beyond the physical dimensions of time and space. Our abstractions are extremely general because they are symbolic, where numeric abstractions are just a special case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CT Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "CT is literally a process for breaking down a problem into smaller parts, looking for patterns in the problems, identifying what kind of information is needed, developing a step-by-step solution, and implementing that solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decomposition\n",
    "2. Pattern Recognition\n",
    "3. Abstraction\n",
    "4. Algorithms\n",
    "5. System Integration (implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decomposition\n",
    "Decomposition is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems. Examples include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing a paper:  \n",
    " - Introduction \n",
    " - Body \n",
    " - Conclusion \n",
    " \n",
    "- Wide-viewed (Panorama) image: \n",
    " - Taking multiple overlapped photos \n",
    " - Stitch them\n",
    " \n",
    "Decomposition often leaves a **framework** of sub-problems that later have to be **assembled (system integration)** to produce a desired solution.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Pattern Recognition\n",
    "Refers to finding similarities, or shared characteristics of problems.  Allows a complex problem to become easier to solve. Allows use of same solution method for each occurrence of the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern recognition allows use of **automation** to process things - its a fundamental drilled shaft of CT.  It also provides a way to use analogs from old problems to address new situations; it too will require **assembly (system integration)** to produce a desired solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine important characteristics of the problem and ignore characteristics that are not important. Use these characteristics to create a representation of what we are trying to solve. \n",

    "An algorithm is a **finite** sequence of defined, instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, can incorporate random input.\n",

    "4. Testing: Experimental design, and conduct of the experiment.\n",
    "5. Analysis: Interpretation of experimental results\n",
    " \n",
    "This protocol can be directly adapted to CT/DS problems as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the problem (problem statement)\n",
    "2. Gather information (identify known and unknown values, and governing equations)\n",
    "3. Generate and evaluate potential solutions\n",
    "4. Refine and implement a solution\n",
    "5. Verify and test the solution.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Explicitly state the problem\n",
    "2. Gather and state Input information, Governing equations or principles, and the required output information.\n",
    "3. Work a sample problem by-hand for testing the general solution.\n",
