    "It is the beginning of the day at a bank, and a crowd of N clients is already waiting for the entrance door to open.Once the bank opens, no more clients arrive, and E employees begin serving the clients. An emplyee takes T minutes to serve each client. How long each client has already been waiting at the moment when the bank door opensis also given.Your have to determine the best way to arrange the clients into E queues,so that the waiting time of the client who waits longest is minimized.The waiting time of a client is the sum of the time the client waited outside before the bank opened,the time the client waited in a queue once the bank opened until the service began, and the service time of the client.\n",
