    "# Sorting\n",
    "A frequent task in data science, engineering, etc. is the seemingly mundane task of\n",
    "sorting or ordering things. Here we explore a couple of simple sorting algorithms,\n",
    "just to show some of the thoughts that go into such a task, then will ultimately resort\n",
    "to the internal sorting routines built into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is frequently necessary when data are being handled; for example in integration\n",
    "and differentiation the data are usually presented to the various algorithms in ascending or\n",
    "descending order (at least on the x-axis).\n",
    "One may have tables of numbers, representing one or more explanatory variables, and one or\n",
    "more responses. At times we may need to arrange these tables in an order dictated by one\n",
    "or another of these various variables. Alternatively we may want to \f",
    "nd the median value\n",
    "or upper quartile of such a list { this task requires sorting.\n",
    "When sorting, one can also carry along operations to maintain correspondence with other\n",
    "lists (for lack of better name lets call this sort-and-carry).\n",
    "Tasks that fall under the broad category of sorting are:\n",
    "- Sort ; rearrange an array of numbers into numerical order (ascending or descending).\n",
    "- Sort and carry along ; rearrange an array of numbers into numerical order while per-\n",
    "forming the same rearrangement of one or more additional arrays so that the correspon-\n",
    "dence between elements in all arrays is maintained (the sets of arrays are essentially\n",
    "a relational database { so that each record (row) maintains the cross-record (\f",
    "elds;\n",
    "columns) relationship).\n",
    "- Index ; given an array, prepare an index table that is a table of pointers that indicates\n",
    "which number array element comes \f",
    "rst in numerical order, which is second, and so\n",
    "on.\n",
    "- Rank ; given an array, prepare a rank table that tells the numerical rank of an array\n",
    "element.\n",
    "The task of sorting `N` elements requires on the order of $K \\cdot Nlog2N$ operations. The\n",
    "algorithm inventor tries to make $K$ as small as possible (understanding that $K = 0$ is\n",
    "practically impossible). Three useful sorting algorithms are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Straight insertion sort;\n",
    "    2. Heapsort sort; and\n",
    "    3. Quicksort sort.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The choice of method depends on the size of the list that needs to be sorted. If the list is\n",
    "short (perhaps $N < 50$ elements) then straight insertion is fast enough, concise, and simple\n",
    "to program. For a long list ($N > 1000$ elements) Quicksort is faster, but achieves the speed\n",
    "by use of extra memory. Heapsort is also good for large lists, and is an in-place routine."

    "The bubble sort is a place to start despite it's relative slowness. It is a pretty reviled\n",
    "algorithm (read the Wikipedia entry), but it is the algorithm that a naive programmer\n",
    "might cobble together in a hurry, and despite its shortcomings (it's really slow and\n",
    "inefficient), it is robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a description of the sorting task as described by Christian and Griffths (2016)\n",
    "(pg. 65):\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to alphabetize your unsorted collection of books. A\n",
    "natural approach would be just to scan across the shelf looking for out-\n",
    "of-order pairs - Wallace followed by Pynchon, for instance - and \n",
    "flipping them around. Put Pynchon ahead of Wallace, then continue your scan,\n",
    "looping around to the beginning of the shelf each time you reach the end.\n",
    "When you make a complete pass without finding any more out-of-order\n",
    "pairs on the entire shelf, then you know the job is done.\n",
    "This process is a Bubble Sort, and it lands us in quadratic time. There\n",
    "are n books out of order, and each scan through the shelf can move each\n",
    "one at most one position. (We spot a tiny problem, make a tiny fix.) So\n",
    "in the worst case, where the shelf is perfectly backward, at least one book\n",
    "will need to be moved n positions. Thus a maximum of n passes through\n",
    "n books, which gives us O(n2) in the worst case. For instance, it\n",
    "means that sorting five shelves of books will take not five times as long as\n",
    "sorting a single shelf, but twenty-five times as long.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the word description into Python is fairly simple. We will have a vector of n\n",
    "numbers (we use a vector because its easy to step through the different positions),\n",
    "and we will scan through the vector once (and essentially find the smallest thing),\n",
    "and put it into the first position. Then we scan again from the second position and\n",
    "find the smallest thing remaining, and put it into the second position, and so on until\n",
    "the last scan which should have the remaining largest thing. If we desire a decreasing\n",
    "order, simply change the sense of the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm defines an array and then sorts by repeated passes through the array.\n",
    "The program (outside of the sorting algorithm) is really quite simple.\n",
    "* Load contents into an array to be sorted.\n",
    "* Echo (print) the array (so we can verify the data are loaded as anticipated).\n",
    "* Loads the sorting function (the two loops)\n",
