    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce tests for two independent groups - a common situation in both experimental and observational research.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental research, the sample sizes may be quite small. However the methods will work fine for large data (many records) sets.\n",
    "An important concept is that the two groups are known to be different by some classification or descriptive variable, and can be separated based on that variable.  \n",
    "Furthermore the ideas of:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) before vs. after (some treatment); \n",
    "\n",
    "   2) pristine vs. impacted; \n",
    "\n",
    "   3) fractured vs. unfractured; \n",
    "\n",
    "   4) upgradient vs. downgradient;\n",
    "\n",
    "   5) other such exclusive distinctions;\n",
    "\n",
    "are utterly important in these kinds of comparisons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also the concept of `pairing` \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of BMP (a stormwater treatment device) performance monitoring. \n",
    "If we monitor a BMP upstream and downstream during different storms, and a sample is collected at <strong>both</strong> locations during the different events, these are `PAIRED` samples, and are the subject of another notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If on the other hand we collect grab samples from a stream at some location on many different days, and in the field notes we observe that some days, the bayou smelled bad (a classification variable), and other days there was no smell, then these two sets of samples (smelly and yummy) are `unpaired`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before-after sampling is also usually `unpaired`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An example -- Assume UNPAIRED\n",
    "Consider two sets of observations of organic nitrogen in samples from an industrial region and from a residential region.\n",
    "First build the data model, and make a boxplot to get an idea of what to expect, our question is are the two areas different? Or more philosophically, given an observation can we make a good guess of whether it is a residential or industrial sample?"
