    "### Construction\n",
    "The construction phase is carried out within the limits defined by the detailed design to create a complete physical project; a building, vehicle, report, computer program, or such -- in Civil Engineering the result is usually something in the built environment, although process control software (SCADA for instance) also fits within this process flow, as does a drainage master plan; the point here is construction actually builds the project into some tangible object.\n",

    "The operation phase is the actual use of the object along with meaningful recordkeeping to assess the success or failure of the project. The operation phase is limited by what the three prior phases have provided.\n",

As a rigid-plastic design is required, an appropriate choice for a measure of the size of a member is its fully plastic moment. The designer has to make decisions upon the fully plastic moment of the beam member, to which a variable $M_1$ will be assigned, and the column members to which variable $M_2$ is assigned.</em>\"\n",

    "Limits on the values the two moments can take are governed by the factor of safety requirement of 2.0 against collapse under the given loading. The designer wants to ensure that in a possible collapse mode of the frame, the work done on the frame by the factored applied loads does not exceede the energy capacity of the plastic deformations (rotations at plastic hinges -- the corner junctions, possibly welds, and the support connections -- also possibly welds) of the frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows six possible collapse mechanisms of the frame and the energy-balance requirement associated with each kinematic mechanism.  There are three general failure mechanisms: a beam failure (a and b), a sway failure (c and d), and combined failure (e and f).  There are two mechanisms for each general failure type because until the sections are specified we do not know if the beam is weaker than the column ($M_1 < M_2$) or the opposite.\n",
